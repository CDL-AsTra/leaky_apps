# Leaky Apps: Large-scale Analysis of Secrets Distributed in Android and iOS Apps

![Figure1](misc/pipeline.svg)

We analyzed what secrets are distributed in mobile apps by
* studying what files Android and iOS apps contain;
* investigating what secrets developers include in the distributed files;
* evaluting differences between Android and iOS;
* studied changes between the app versions of 2023 and 2024.
