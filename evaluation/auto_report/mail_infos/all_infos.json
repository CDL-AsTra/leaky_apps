    "Source Code": "**Included code files** If the code contains app code, it can help attackers reverse engineer your app or use it for social engineering attacks, e.g., the code can include information from developers like names or internal links. Hackers can use this information to start targeted phishing campaigns against the developers. It can also reveal the library versions used; attackers can use this to find known vulnerabilities, if any. We recommend removing the mentioned Code folder from the released app.",
    "AWS": "**Hardcoded Credentials** We found hardcoded AWS credentials (access and secret key) %CREDENTIALS% (removed parts of the key from the mail) in the following file %FILES%. The credentials can give attackers unauthorized AWS cloud resource access and might lead to data breaches on AWS. We recommend revoking the keys and using Amazon Cognito instead.",
    "Google Cloud": "**Hardcoded credentials** We found Google Cloud service credentials. Attackers could access or modify your Google Cloud resources using the service account credentials. According to Google's best practice, we recommend switching to API keys instead and revoking the service account credentials: https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-credentials.",
    "Repositories": "**Hardcoded Credentials** We found hardcoded credentials %CREDENTIALS% (removed parts of the key from the mail) in the files %FILES%. The credentials give attackers access to private repositories and could allow attackers to add malicious code to your repositories. We recommend revoking the key, updating the app, and investigating past commits of the respective user.",
    "General Hardcoded Credentials": "**Hardcoded Credentials** We found hardcoded %TYPE% credentials %CREDENTIALS% (removed parts of the key from the mail) in the files %FILES%. %FROM_TRUFFLEHOG% We recommend revoking the key and using fine-grained access tokens recommended by the service.",
    "URI": "**Hardcoded URI Credentials** We found hardcoded URI credentials %CREDENTIALS% (removed parts of the key from the mail) in the files %FILES%. Attackers can use URI credentials to access restricted resources. We recommend revoking the key and using fine-grained access tokens.",
    "Podfile": "**Included Podfile** We found a Podfile in your app. Podfiles are used for dependency management. Thus, it can provide attackers with valuable information, e.g., internal repository names and library versions used. Hackers can use this information to start targeted phishing campaigns or use the library versions' information to find known vulnerabilities, if any exist. We recommend removing the mentioned Podfile from the released app or reviewing it to see if it contains any sensitive information.",
    "spm_versions": "**Included SPM Version file** We found a spmversions.json file in your app. It can provide attackers with valuable information, e.g., library versions used by the app. Hackers can use the library versions' information to find known vulnerabilities, if any exist. We recommend removing the mentioned file from the released app or reviewing it to see if it contains any sensitive information.",
    "Dependency Management File": "**Included Dependency Management File** We found at least one dependency management file in your app. Those files can provide attackers with valuable information, e.g., internal repository names and library versions used. Hackers can use this information to start targeted phishing campaigns or use the library versions' information to find known vulnerabilities if any exist. We recommend removing the file from the released app or reviewing it to see if it contains sensitive information. Our analysis detected the following files: \n%FILES%"
